Prompt1: Using python, define a GameLogic class with a calculate_score static method and roll_dice static method. The calculate_score method have a parameter that requires a tuple of integers that represents a dice roll, the output from calculate_score should be an integer representing the rollâ€™s score according to the rules of the game farkle. The roll_dice method should have an input of an integer between 1-6 and the output should be a tuple with random values between 1 and 6. The length of the output tuple for roll_dice should match the input argument.
