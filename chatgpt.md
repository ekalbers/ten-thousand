# ChatGPT prompts and responses

## Prompt 1
- PROMPT: Using python, define a GameLogic class with a calculate_score static method and roll_dice static method. The calculate_score method have a parameter that requires a tuple of integers that represents a dice roll, the output from calculate_score should be an integer representing the rollâ€™s score according to the rules of the game farkle. The roll_dice method should have an input of an integer between 1-6 and the output should be a tuple with random values between 1 and 6. The length of the output tuple for roll_dice should match the input argument.

## Prompt 4
- PROMPT: Change the calculate_score method to account for the fact that three of a kind for numbers other than 1 and 5 are equal to 100 times whatever the number is, and it doubles with every extra occurrence of that number

## Prompt 5
- PROMPT: The last result had a slight when using i to multiply it needs to have 1 added to it to make it equal to the number it actually corresponds to on the dice. please fix this.

## Prompt 8
- PROMPT: The last response only accounts for if pairs of 1, 2, and 3 are rolled, I need it to work with any combination of 3 pairs
  - this code is close but obviously it is checking for an extra pair, the sorted `dice_coutns` list should look like this: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]`
  - I attempted to get ChatGPT to fix its mistake but it couldn't quite figure out the problem so I ended up just giving it the correct answer

    dice_counts = [dice_roll.count(i) for i in range(1, 7)]

    # changed to check the sorted array but added an extra pair for some reason
    if sorted(dice_counts) == [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2]:
        score = 1500
    elif dice_counts == [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]:
        score = 2000
    else:
        for i, count in enumerate(dice_counts):
            if count >= 3:
                if i == 0:
                    score += (1000 * (2 ** (count - 3)))
                elif i == 4:
                    score += (500 * (2 ** (count - 3)))
                else:
                    score += ((i+1) * 100 * (2 ** (count - 3)))
            elif count > 0:
                if i == 0:
                    score += (count * 100)

## Prompt 9
- ***** Before prompt 9 I gave ChatGPT the solution to the issue with the sorted list in the code above
- PROMPT: change the calculate_score method to double the score if there are two three of a kinds
  - so ChatGpt actually did what I asked for but it also added some funky stuff.
    - The top of the if statement it tries to check for three different 3 of a kinds, this does not make sense as this would mean we rolled the dice 9 times, this code will always be skipped so i removed it.
    - even though I told ChatGPT it needed to change sorted `dice_counts` list when checking pairs to `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]` and it acknowledged and printed out a new method, it reverted back to the wrong list here.
